I am an enthusiastic Junior Software Developer, with a degree in Accountancy, 
studying with CodeClan looking to pivot from a rewarding career as a retail store manager.  
This change was inspired after being involved in a project to improve our Starbucks app 
and have found software development a comfortable transition for me pulling on my existing skills 
as a creative problem solver, dependable team player and a respected mentor and coach 
with an inner curiosity and a hunger to learn.  

I would like to join a dynamic and engaged software development team 
that believes in challenging new developers to contribute in inspiring ways.
